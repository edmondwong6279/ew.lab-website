# ew.lab-website

NextJS 13 project with the app router.

## TO DO

- Create all components
- Sort styling into tailwind only- or just use sass?
- Add the favicon

## Dev Notes

The work section has been hardcoded instead of using a dynamic slug (e.g. [project].tsx) because then everything can be prerendered on the server and so will vastly improve performance.

At the moment, styling has a mix of tailwind and sass.
