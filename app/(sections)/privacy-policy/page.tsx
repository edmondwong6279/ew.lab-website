        <p>
          This site is owned and operated by Lab Group Services Ltd (hereafter
          referred to as “Lab”). Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost
          importance to us. At Lab, we want to make your experience online
          satisfying and safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we
          feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and
          conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This
          privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use
          it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>INFORMATION WE GATHER AND TRACK</h5>
        <p>We gather two types of information about users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information that users provide through optional, voluntary
            submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our
            electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or
            forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls, surveys
            and competitions
          </li>
          <li>
            Information we gather through aggregated tracking information
            derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. This
            information allows us to better tailor our content to
            readers&apos;/users’ needs. Under no circumstances do we divulge any
            information about an individual user to a third party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          We Gather User Information In The Following Processes: Optional
          Voluntary Information.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We offer the following services, which require some type of voluntary
          submission of personal information by users:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches): We will offer a free
            electronic newsletter to users. We gather the email addresses of
            users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from
            this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter
            that points users to the subscription management.
          </li>
          <li>
            E-mail this to a friend&quot; policy: Our site users can choose to
            electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by
            clicking &quot;e-mail this to a friend&quot;. The user must provide
            their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This
            information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of
            course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The
            information is not used for any other purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your participation on our Site may mean that we occasionally contact
            you with the opportunity to enter competitions. Entry to
            competitions is voluntary, and you are under no obligation to take
            up an invitation from us to enter. Should you choose to enter a
            competition, we will treat the information you provide with the same
            high standard of care as all other customer information, and use the
            information provided strictly within the entry terms of the
            competition and this Privacy Statement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Polling: We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily
            share their opinions with other users and see what our audience
            thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls
            are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We
            may use a system to &quot;tag&quot; users after they have voted, so
            they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not
            correlated with information about individual users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Surveys: We may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target
            our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated
            demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors,
            advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information
            about specific individuals with any third party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h5 className={styles.lighter}>USAGE TRACKING</h5>
        <p>
          We track user traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not
          correlate this information with data about individual users. We break
          down overall usage statistics according to a user’s domain name,
          browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the
          browser string (information contained in every user&apos;s browser).
        </p>
        <p>
          We sometimes track and catalogue the search terms that user’s enter in
          our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with
          individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas
          of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those
          areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well
          each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better
          service for you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>COOKIES</h3>
        <p>
          We may place a text file called a &quot;cookie&quot; in the browser
          files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal
          Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site
          to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But
          the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you
          supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read
          cookie files created by other site. We use cookies to track user
          traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers
          a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you
          have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will
          receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have
          cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to
          participate actively in message boards, forums, polling, surveys and
          competitions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 className={styles.lighter}>USE OF INFORMATION</h5>
        <p>
          We use any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their
          experience in our site or products, whether to provide interactive or
          personalised elements on the site or to better prepare future content
          based on the interests of our users. As stated above, we use
          information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out
          electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,
          surveys, competitions, message boards, and forums. We send out
          newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the
          newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think
          subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are
          doing. We never share newsletter mailing lists with any third parties,
          including advertisers, sponsors or partners. When we use tracking
          information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not
          like based on traffic to those areas, we do not track what individual
          users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps
          us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms
          entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests
          our users. But we do not track which terms a particular user enters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns
          for advertisers, sponsors and partners. Because we do not track the
          usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will
          never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose
          any information about any individual user except to comply with
          applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal
          safety of our users or the public.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 className={styles.lighter}>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</h5>
        <p>
          We use the above-described information to tailor our content to suit
          your needs. We will not share information about individual users with
          any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal
          process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 className={styles.lighter}>SECURITY</h5>
        <p>
          We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard
          firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy
          policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only
          authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our
          customers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>OPT-IN / OUT POLICY</h5>
        <p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical.</p>
        <p>Such choices include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Opting to register to receive our electronic newsletters.</li>
          <li>
            Opting to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely
            alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable
            information from our users.
          </li>
          <li>Ability to opt-out of email newsletters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>YOUR CONSENT</p>
        <p>
          By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this
          information by Lab. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will
          post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what
          information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we
          disclose it.
